== DESCRIPTION

Hub project for tools to regurgitate implemented specs in their purely descriptive and nested form.

For instance, for Shoulda:

context "A Foo" do
  context "when it does bar" do
    should "output blech" do
      # impl here
    end
  end
end

... would be rendered as:

A Foo
  when it does bar
    should output blech
